# Welcome to BRaIN Lab GitHub Presentation

This is a basic **readme** file that will be shown automatically at the bottom of the folder that contains this file.
**Note:** The redme file should be named as *`README.md`* to be able to see the contents in GitHub.

## what is markdown?
If you examine the contents of the *README* file, you will see that titles, bold and italic faces, etc. are created using *markdowns*. In fact, *markdown* is a very popular method of text control, you can use it in Jupyter and even in Slack [with some exceptions](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/slack/).

## how can I create *markdown* files?
Good question. Feel free to start a new text file on your desktop and write your first *markdown* file. However, if you need a little help, you can try [https://stackedit.io/](https://stackedit.io/) for a cloud-based markdown experience or download [**wirtage**](http://www.writage.com/) as an Add-In to you Microsoft Word.

## what's next?
Well, you can either do more research on *markdown* and its fascinating capabilities, look more into creating GitHub Wiki and documentation, or continue with the presentation.
